# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
### Deploy smart contract token
npx hardhat run --network manta scripts/deploy-token.ts
### Deploy smart contract airdrop
npx hardhat run --network manta scripts/deploy-airdrop.ts
```

# Airdrop-Token
"# Airdrop-token"
